# spec: contacts-v1

This document defines a spec for the *contacts-v1* document type. It is the input to a coding agent that will do the implementation.

## Example document

(Shown with the **actual emitted tokens**; the original design sketch used
`<pos-22>` / `<begin-sequence>` / `<begin-structure>` and lowercase amino
acids, but per the decisions below those are realized as the
contacts-and-distances-v1 tokens `<p22>` / `<begin_sequence>` /
`<begin_statements>` and uppercase `<ALA>` …)

(Eight residues, so the contacts respect the `min_seq_separation = 6` minimum
below — a three-residue example could not carry a legal contact at all.)

```
<contacts-v1>
<begin_sequence>
<p23> <PHE>
<n-term> <p20>
<p26> <LYS>
<p25> <THR>
<p27> <VAL>
<p21> <ALA>
<p22> <GLY>
<c-term> <p27>
<p20> <MET>
<p24> <SER>
<begin_statements>
<contact> <p21> <p27>
<contact> <p20> <p26>
<end>
```

## Details

We have two sections: a sequence section (starting with `<begin_sequence>`) and a structure section (starting with `<begin_statements>`).

### Sequence section
This consists of three kinds of statements.

`<pXXX> <RESIDUE>` indicates that position XXX is the given amino acid. The position tokens are contacts-and-distances-v1's `<p0>` through `<p1999>` (2000 indices total), reused rather than minted anew.

`<n-term>` `<pXXX>` indicates that position XXX is the N-terminus of a protein chain

`<c-term>` `<pXXX>` indicates that position XXX is the C-terminus of a protein chain.

The statements of the sequence section are given in random order. We define the amino acid for all residues exactly once. We define the N- and C-termini for each protein chain.

### Residue indexing
We support structures with up to 2000 residues

Rather than numbering residues in a protein as e.g. 0 to 1999, each time we generate a document we pick a random number n in [0, 2000) to be the n-terminal residue. We start indexing from this residue. Residue indices "wrap around", so the residue after `<p1999>` is `<p0>`. The motivation here is that we want the model to be experienced in using all residue indices. Since most proteins are way less than 2000 residues, if we always started the protein chain off at `<p0>` the model would only rarely see the higher value indices.

In the future we will support multiple protein chains, and we will just have multiple <n-term> and <c-term> statements for these. They will need to be spaced out enough to not overlap. For example we might have one protein that starts at index 1800 and continues until residue 100, and another that starts at residue 300 and continues until 800.

### Structure section
The structure section consists of statements of the form `<contact>` `<pXXX>` `<pYYY>`, which indicates that residues at index XXX and YYY are in contact.

Contacts are defined as contact degree > 0 where contact degree is implemented in [pyconfind](https://github.com/timodonnell/pyconfind). We run pyconfind in `native_only=True` mode, i.e. only consider the actual given amino acid at each position rather than all other possibilities.

We also require a minimum primary-sequence separation: a pair of residues at sequence positions i and j is only a contact if `|i - j| >= min_seq_separation` (default 6). Residues 5 or fewer positions apart in the chain are never contacts, regardless of geometry — this keeps trivial local / secondary-structure contacts out of the documents.

Before selecting which contacts to include, we discard any contact whose contact degree is below a minimum threshold (`min_contact_degree`, default 0.001). Contacts below this threshold are **never** written to a document, even if there is room for them. (pyconfind reports many very weak contacts — degrees down to ~1e-8 — and this threshold keeps those noise-level contacts out.)

From the contacts that pass this threshold, we include the N with the highest contact degree (the N strongest), where N is chosen so the document fills the 8192-token budget (see Document length). These N selected contacts are then listed in **random order** in the structure section — they are *not* sorted by degree. (We select by strength so that, when a protein has more above-threshold contacts than fit, the weakest are the ones dropped; but the order they appear in the document is randomized so the model does not learn a degree-sorted ordering.)

Note that the contact matrix is symmetric. We randomize the order that each contact pair is given in: if there is a contact between XXX and YYY, with 50% probability we output `<contact> <pXXX> <pYYY>` and the other half of the time we output `<contact> <pYYY> <pXXX>`. Each contact is only specified once, i.e. once we emit the contact between XXX and YYY we will never emit it again in either order.

### Document length
Our max document length is 8192 tokens. N (the number of contacts included) is the number of the strongest *above-threshold* contacts whose `<contact>` statements fit in the budget remaining after the sequence section. If the protein has more above-threshold contacts than fit, the weakest of them are dropped (truncation); if it has fewer, all above-threshold contacts are included and the document is shorter than the budget.

### Additional tokens
For the vocab, also include as additional tokens all the tokens in the contacts-and-distances-v1 [vocab](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/blob/main/marinfold/marinfold/document_structures/contacts_and_distances_v1/vocab.py). We may fine tune on documents like that later. Also include this additional token: `<think>`

## Implementation notes & discrepancies

This section records where the implementation (in this directory:
`vocab.py`, `parse.py`, `generate.py`, `cli.py`) **diverges from** or
**pins down** the spec above. It is the source of truth for the
as-built behavior. **Keep it current** whenever the implementation or
the spec changes.

### Decisions that override the spec text

contacts-v1 **reuses contacts-and-distances-v1 tokens wherever an
equivalent already exists**, so the two structures share token IDs /
embeddings and a contacts-v1 model can be fine-tuned on
contacts-and-distances-v1 documents without a tokenizer change. This
overrides the spec's own token spellings:

- **Position tokens reuse `<p0>` … `<p1999>`.** The *Details* section's
  `<pXXX>` indices (sketched as `<pos-0000>` / `<pos-22>` in the original
  draft) are contacts-and-distances-v1's existing `<p0>`–`<p2700>`
  position tokens; contacts-v1 uses the first 2000 of them and mints no
  `<pos-N>` tokens. Note a contacts-v1 position is a *randomized
  wrap-around* index, whereas the same `<pX>` in contacts-and-distances-v1
  is a true chain position — the leading doc-type token distinguishes the
  two interpretations.
- **Section markers reuse `<begin_sequence>` / `<begin_statements>`.**
  The spec's `<begin-sequence>` / `<begin-structure>` are realized as
  contacts-and-distances-v1's underscore-spelled markers (so
  `<begin_statements>` opens the structure section).
- **Amino-acid tokens reuse the uppercase `<ALA>` … `<VAL>`.** The
  example's lowercase (`<phe>`, `<ala>`) is not used; reusing the
  uppercase AAs shares amino-acid embeddings with contacts-and-distances-v1.
- **`<end>` is the shared contacts-and-distances-v1 token** too.

The only tokens contacts-v1 mints itself are `<contacts-v1>`, `<n-term>`,
`<c-term>`, `<contact>`, and `<think>` — five tokens with no
contacts-and-distances-v1 analog. `<think>` is a *pause* token that is
emitted only under `GenerationConfig(think=True)` (see *Think (pause)
tokens* below); the default generator does not emit it, but it has always
been reserved in the vocab so no tokenizer change was needed to add the
think path. (The original example's `<c-term> <pos 22>` space typo is
emitted as `<c-term> <p22>`.)

### Points the spec left open (implementation choices)

- **Residue + contact source.** Both the residue sequence and the
  contacts come from a single `pyconfind.analyze(..., native_only=True)`
  call, read off pyconfind's ordered *position* list, so they are always
  mutually consistent. Contacts reference residues by 0-based sequence
  index with `seq_i < seq_j`.
- **pyconfind parameters.** confind/C++ defaults: `contact_distance=3.0`,
  `dcut=25.0`, `clash_distance=2.0`, plus `native_only=True`. We pass
  `assembly=None` by default, i.e. analyze the asymmetric unit / input
  structure as-is rather than implicitly expanding biological assembly 1.
  pyconfind returns every contact with degree > 0 (down to ~1e-8); the
  `min_contact_degree` filter above then decides which are eligible.
  These (including `--assembly` and `min_contact_degree`) are exposed as
  CLI knobs but default to the above.
- **Non-canonical residues.** pyconfind's "legal" protein residues
  beyond the standard 20 (HIS variants HSD/HSE/HSC/HSP/HIP, plus MSE,
  SEC, CSO, SEP, TPO, PTR) are canonicalized to their parent amino acid
  (e.g. MSE→MET, HSD→HIS, SEP→SER). Anything unexpected maps to `<UNK>`
  (reused from the contacts-and-distances-v1 vocab).
- **Single chain only.** Multi-chain support is future work per the spec.
  Structures with more than one protein chain are skipped (with a
  warning); exactly one `<n-term>` and one `<c-term>` are emitted.
- **Residue-count bounds.** "Up to 2000 residues" is enforced: chains
  with fewer than 2 residues or more than 2000 (can't be uniquely
  indexed under wrap-around) are skipped with a warning.
- **Minimum sequence separation.** A pair counts as a contact only if its
  residues are at least `config.min_seq_separation` (default 6) positions
  apart in the primary sequence (`seq_j - seq_i >= min_seq_separation`).
  This is *definitional* — closer pairs are filtered before anything is
  counted, so `contacts_pre_filter` (and the degree statistics) already
  exclude them. (`contacts-and-distances-v1` used the same minimum of 6 via
  its `short_range_sep`.)
- **Minimum degree filter.** Contacts with degree below
  `config.min_contact_degree` (default 0.001) are dropped before anything
  else and are never emitted, regardless of budget. pyconfind returns a
  long tail of near-zero-degree contacts (down to ~1e-8); this keeps that
  noise out of documents.
- **Contact selection & ordering.** From the above-threshold contacts,
  selection of the N strongest uses a *stable* sort by descending degree,
  so equal-degree contacts at the truncation boundary break ties by
  pyconfind's `(seq_i, seq_j)`-ascending order — deterministic. The
  selected N are then shuffled, so the order in the document is random
  (not degree-sorted).
- **Truncation.** The whole sequence section is kept when it fits; if the
  framing + sequence section alone exceeds the context budget, the protein
  is skipped with a warning. Otherwise the N strongest *above-threshold*
  contacts fill the remaining budget, `N = floor((8192 − frame − sequence)
  / 3)` capped at the number passing the filter. `truncated` means a
  budget overflow specifically — some above-threshold contact didn't fit
  (`contacts_passing_min_degree > contacts_emitted`) — not that the
  degree filter dropped something.
- **Determinism.** Seeded by `random.Random(int(sha1(entry_id)[:8], 16))`
  (same scheme as contacts-and-distances-v1). RNG draws happen in a
  fixed, load-bearing order: (1) the random n-terminal start index, then
  (2) the shuffle of the sequence-section statements, then (3) the
  shuffle of the N selected contacts (their in-document order), then
  (4) the per-contact pair-order coin flips. When `think=True` two more
  draw groups bracket these: **(0)** the think-overhead sample happens
  *first*, right after seeding and before the start index (so its count is
  known in time to reserve budget), and **(5)** the think-run slot
  assignment happens *last*, after the flips. When `think=False` (the
  default) neither group draws anything, so the stream — and therefore
  the document — is byte-identical to the pre-think generator.
- **Vocab order.** Load-bearing and append-only: the 5 native tokens
  (`<contacts-v1>`, `<n-term>`, `<c-term>`, `<contact>`, `<think>`), then
  the entire contacts-and-distances-v1 `all_domain_tokens()` list, then the
  single sequence-only doc-type token `<contacts-v1.sequence_only>` (see
  *Sequence-only variant* below). The three groups are disjoint —
  contacts-v1 reuses c-and-d-v1 tokens by *emitting* them, not by
  re-minting — so no dedup is needed. The sequence-only token is appended
  **last**, so adding it left every pre-existing id unchanged. Total domain
  vocab = 2844 tokens (2846 with `<pad>`/`<eos>`).

### Think (pause) tokens (`think=True`)

`GenerationConfig(think=True)` augments the **structure section** with
`<think>` (pause) tokens — the contacts-v1 analog of
[#34](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/issues/34) (which produced
`contacts-and-distances-v2`). See [#123](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/issues/123).
At training time these are loss-masked, giving the model "free" compute to
spend before it commits to a prediction ([Goyal et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02226)).
The switch defaults to **off**; when off the generator is byte-identical to
before this path existed (see *Determinism*). It is inert on the
`sequence_only` path (there is no structure section to augment).

- **What/where.** `<think>` runs sit **between** `<contact>` statements
  (never inside a `<contact> <pX> <pY>` triple), only in the structure
  section (the predicted part). The sequence section is the given prompt
  and stays think-free. contacts-v1 statements are uniform 3-token
  `<contact>` statements, so "between statements" simply means "before a
  `<contact>`" — there is no pLDDT token and none of #34's
  think-before-pLDDT tie-break.
- **Sampling (identical distributions to #34, via ported `_geometric` /
  `_sample_think_overhead`).**
  - **Initial run.** With probability `think_initial_prob` (0.75) place
    `k1 ~ Geometric(think_initial_geom_p=0.13)` (support ≥ 1) `<think>`
    tokens at slot 0 — right after `<begin_statements>`. Otherwise `k1 = 0`.
  - **Additional runs.** Draw `k2 ~ Uniform(think_additional_count_range =
    (-4, 4))` and add `max(int(k2), 0)` further runs, each of length
    `Geometric(think_run_length_geom_p=0.25)`, at random inter-statement
    slots `∈ [0, N-1]` (slot `i` = "right before `emitted[i]`"). Runs
    landing in the same slot are concatenated.
- **Budget.** The total think-token count is subtracted from the 8192-token
  budget **before** choosing how many contacts fit, so documents still end
  with `<end>` and never overflow. Fewer contacts are emitted than the
  same protein would get with `think=False`.
- **No-contacts edge case.** When the structure section is empty (no
  above-threshold, seq-sep-respecting contacts) but the initial-run gate
  fired, the initial run is still emitted (right after
  `<begin_statements>`); the additional runs have no statement to anchor to
  and are dropped. Mirrors #34.
- **Doc type / vocab.** No new doc type and **no vocab/tokenizer change** —
  think-augmented documents are still `<contacts-v1>` and reuse the
  already-reserved `<think>` token, so existing contacts-v1 checkpoints stay
  token-compatible and a mixed (with/without think) corpus trains under
  them. (Minting a `<contacts-v2>` doc type was considered and rejected.)
- **Metadata.** `think_tokens` records how many `<think>` tokens the
  document actually contains (0 when `think=False`).

### Metadata tracked (beyond the spec)

The spec does not define output metadata; the issue asks to track
protein-docs-style metadata. Per document we record: `entry_id`,
`seq_len`, `global_plddt` (mean CA B-factor), `start_index`,
`n_term_index`, `c_term_index`, `min_seq_separation`, `num_tokens`,
`think_tokens` (count of emitted `<think>` tokens; 0 unless `think=True`),
`sha1` of the document, and the following contact statistics:

- `min_seq_separation` — the minimum sequence separation used for this
  row's contact definition.
- `contacts_pre_filter` — total contacts (degree > 0) that survived the
  `min_seq_separation` definition.
- `contacts_passing_min_degree` — how many passed the `min_contact_degree`
  filter (the pool the strongest N are chosen from).
- `contacts_emitted` — how many were included in the document.
- `contacts_excluded` — how many did not make it in (`pre_filter −
  emitted`); counts both below-threshold and budget-truncated contacts.
- `truncated` — whether a budget overflow dropped any above-threshold
  contact (`contacts_passing_min_degree > contacts_emitted`).
- `highest_contact_degree` — max degree over the protein's surviving
  (`min_seq_separation`-respecting) contacts.
- `lowest_nonzero_contact_degree` — min degree over the protein's
  surviving contacts (pyconfind only returns degree > 0, so this is the
  smallest positive degree, which may be below the filter threshold).
- `lowest_included_contact_degree` — min degree among the contacts that
  made it into the document (always ≥ `min_contact_degree`).

The whole-protein degree fields (`highest_contact_degree`,
`lowest_nonzero_contact_degree`) are null when the protein has no contacts
at all; `lowest_included_contact_degree` is null when nothing was emitted
(no contacts, or all below threshold). The local `--summary-out` JSON
additionally lists the full residue sequence and every emitted contact
with its contact-degree value and the residue numbers/names it connects.

### Sequence-only variant (`contacts-v1.sequence_only`)

A second document type that carries **only the sequence section** — no
structure section, no contacts. It exists to fold a large sequence-only
corpus (UniRef50; see
[exp64](../../../../experiments/exp64_data_contacts_v1_sequence_only))
into the contacts-v1 token space, so the two corpora can be trained
together under one tokenizer.

- **Document shape.** `<contacts-v1.sequence_only> <begin_sequence> …
  sequence statements … <end>`. Under the default `think=False`, the sequence
  section is **byte-identical** to what `<contacts-v1>` emits for the same
  `entry_id` + residues: same random wrap-around start index, same
  `<n-term>`/`<c-term>` markers, same shuffled `<pX> <AA>` statements (pinned
  by `tests/.../test_sequence_only.py`). The guarantee is scoped to that
  default: `think=True` draws the think-overhead sample *before* the start
  index (see *Determinism*), which shifts the RNG stream, so a `think=True`
  contacts-v1 document has a different sequence section. Think is inert on the
  sequence-only path itself, so its own output is unaffected either way.
  Only the leading doc-type token and the absence of the `<begin_statements>`
  structure section differ; the frame is 3 tokens (not 4).
- **Token.** `<contacts-v1.sequence_only>` is minted by contacts-v1 but is
  **not** one of the 5 native tokens — it is appended last in
  `all_domain_tokens()` (the `sequence_only_tokens()` group) so that adding
  it preserved every pre-existing token id.
- **Generation.** `GenerationConfig(sequence_only=True)` switches
  `build_document` to this branch (the pyconfind geometry / contact knobs
  are then ignored). `generate_sequence_only_document(sequence, entry_id=…)`
  is the structure-free entry point: it maps a one-letter sequence to
  residues via `parse.residues_from_sequence` (standard-20 → 3-letter;
  anything else → `<UNK>`) and calls the builder. **No pyconfind** is
  involved, so sequence-only generation needs no `contacts-v1` extra.
- **Metadata.** The contact-statistics columns (`contacts_pre_filter`,
  `contacts_emitted`, `highest_contact_degree`, …) are not meaningful and
  are reported as `0` / `None`; `seq_len`, `start_index`, `n_term_index`,
  `c_term_index`, `num_tokens`, `sha1` carry through as usual, so the parquet
  schema stays compatible with the contacts-v1 corpus.

### Not yet implemented

- Multiple protein chains (multiple `<n-term>`/`<c-term>`, spaced-out
  index ranges) — see *Residue indexing* above.
- Model inference / evaluation against this structure (there is no
  trained contacts-v1 model yet); only `generate` / `view` / `tokenizer`
  exist.
