# exp: evaluate best contacts-v1 model on current eval set

**Issue:** [#89](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/issues/89) · **Kind:** `evals` · **Branch:** `exp/89-contacts-v1-model-on-eval-set`

## Question

How well does the best model @eric-czech trained in
[#61](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/issues/61) (the one with eval
loss **2.7566**) predict residue–residue contacts on our current curated eval
set, alongside every other predictor (Protenix-v2 single-seq / MSA, ESMFold,
ESMFold2)?

## Hypothesis

N/A. (Prior from [#82](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/issues/82): the
*quick* contacts-v1 1.5B from #67 was ~chance at de-novo contact prediction.
#89 is exactly exp82's named open follow-up — *does the carefully-tuned #61/#75
model close the gap?*)

## Background

- **The eval set** ([#74](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/issues/74) /
  [#78](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/issues/78)) — **554 proteins**:
  FoldBench-100 + 454 exp65 low-MSA / novel-fold candidates. Ground-truth
  contacts are pyconfind side-chain contacts on the experimental structure
  (`native_only=True`, degree ≥ 0.001, sequence-separation ≥ 6) — defined
  identically to the contacts-v1 training documents. exp74/exp78 already scored
  **Protenix-v2** (single-seq / MSA) and **ESMFold / ESMFold2** on it; we splice
  those in unchanged and add MarinFold.
- **The model** — eric-czech's #75 tuning sweep winner. Found via marin branch
  `eac/plm-exp75` → W&B `eric-czech/marin` (group `exp75-contacts-v1-tune`) → GCS:
  - W&B run **`prot-exp75-cv1-1_5b-e8-lr1e-3-wd0p2-v1`** (`…-bc3084`): Qwen3 1.47B,
    **epochs 8, lr 1e-3, wd 0.2**; final `eval/contacts-v1-val/loss` = **2.756602**
    at **step 35679** (the single permanent checkpoint).
  - Levanter checkpoint: `gs://marin-us-east5/checkpoints/prot-exp75-cv1-1_5b-e8-lr1e-3-wd0p2-v1-bc3084/checkpoints/step-35679/`.
  - Tokenizer `timodonnell/contacts-v1-tokenizer@5d68a24a899f` (2845 vocab).
- **Inference algorithm** — exp82 found **pairwise** scoring extracts the most
  signal (rollout/iterative did not beat it; structured inference can't bootstrap
  when the unconditional signal is weak). We use pairwise — "the best inference
  approach identified in #82".

## Method (reproduction spec)

A three-step harness; GT and model scoring run in separate venvs (pyconfind vs
torch), and the metric step is backend-agnostic.

0. **Export the checkpoint** — [`export_contacts_v1_best_to_hf.py`](export_contacts_v1_best_to_hf.py).
   The run was never HF-exported (its `hf_save_path` was empty), so we convert
   the levanter checkpoint to HF safetensors via levanter's `export_lm_to_hf`
   (CPU), with the exp75 Qwen3 config + contacts-v1 tokenizer co-located. Result:
   `Qwen3ForCausalLM`, vocab 2845, published to the open-athena bucket at
   `checkpoints/prot-exp75-cv1-1_5b-e8-lr1e-3-wd0p2-v1-bc3084/hf/step-35679/`.
1. **GT universe** — [`prepare_gt_universe.py`](prepare_gt_universe.py). For each
   protein, run pyconfind on the GT structure (exactly as exp74/exp78) and record,
   in input-sequence coordinates, `L`, the **resolved-residue set** (the
   candidate-pair universe, identical across all predictors), and every degree>0
   contact → `data/gt_universe.jsonl`. Verified bit-identical to the saved exp78
   GT contacts.
2. **MarinFold pairwise scores** — [`score_eval_set.py`](score_eval_set.py).
   Build the contacts-v1 **sequence-section prefix** from each input sequence (the
   official deterministic `build_document` with empty contacts), then score every
   candidate pair as the symmetrized geometric-mean log-prob of `<contact> <pi> <pj>`
   (exp82 pairwise). Output: one `[L,L]` score matrix per protein.
   - Canonical numbers were produced with the **exp82 transformers scorer**
     (CUDA, local) — identical math, faster to iterate, no shared-TPU contention.
   - [`score_eval_set_vllm.py`](score_eval_set_vllm.py) is the **vLLM / iris-TPU**
     reproduction (same scoring definition, same `npz` layout; generation-logprobs,
     the path eric's `eval_protein_contacts` already runs on TPU) — see *Running*.
3. **Metrics** — [`compute_metrics.py`](compute_metrics.py). Feed each MarinFold
   score matrix into the exp74 metric over the resolved universe: precision @
   {L, L/2, L/5}, **R-precision**, and **AUC**, per range (all / short [6,11] /
   medium [12,23] / long [≥24]). **AUC** is added here for *every* predictor
   (MarinFold + Protenix-structure SS/MSA + ESMFold + ESMFold2) over the same
   universe, since the existing tables carried only precision. Plots:
   [`plot.py`](plot.py); slides: `build_summary.py` → `plots/summary.pdf`.

## Success criteria

Eval succeeds for all 554 eval-set proteins; AUC + contacts @ {R, L, L/2, L/5}
for MarinFold reported next to every other predictor.

## Results

All **554** proteins scored, **0 failures** (`data/timings.csv`; mean 4.9 s,
max 63 s on one A5000). Full table: `data/contact_precision_all.csv`; plots:
`plots/`; slides: `plots/summary.pdf`.

**Headline — long-range (seq-sep ≥ 24), mean over 554 proteins:**

| predictor | AUC | R-precision | contacts@L |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MarinFold-cv1 1.5B (sequence only)** | **0.881** | 0.269 | 0.188 |
| Protenix-v2 · single-seq (structure) | 0.815 | 0.572 | 0.326 |
| Protenix-v2 · MSA (structure) | 0.935 | 0.795 | 0.465 |
| ESMFold (single-seq) | 0.892 | 0.732 | 0.418 |
| ESMFold2 (single-seq) | 0.916 | 0.769 | 0.443 |

(Aggregate-range AUC: MarinFold **0.904**, Protenix-SS 0.830, Protenix-MSA
0.941, ESMFold 0.901, ESMFold2 0.923.)

**vs the earlier #67 model.** Scoring Tim's quick contacts-v1 1.5B from
[#67](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/issues/67)
(`…-unmasked-3b5cf2/hf/step-11999`, plain Llama, eval loss **2.980**) through the
same harness shows what Eric's tuning bought: a **0.22 lower eval loss
(2.98 → 2.76)** turns a **near-chance** predictor into a useful one.

| long-range | AUC | R-precision | contacts@L |
|---|---|---|---|
| MarinFold **#67** (Tim, 2.980) | 0.616 | 0.022 | 0.021 |
| MarinFold **#61/#75** (Eric, 2.756) | **0.881** | **0.269** | **0.188** |

#67 is barely above chance (AUC 0.62; R-precision 0.02 ≈ random) — consistent
with exp82's read — while the tuned #61 model is ~9–12× better at top-K
precision and lands at ESMFold-class ranking AUC.

**1. Ranking AUC — the sequence-only LM is competitive.** MarinFold's
long-range contact-ranking AUC (**0.881**; 0.904 aggregate) **matches ESMFold**
and **beats single-sequence Protenix-v2** (0.815), trailing only Protenix-MSA
and ESMFold2. It is **robust to MSA depth** (long-range AUC 0.87 / 0.85 / 0.91 /
0.90 over orphan / marginal / low / deep tiers) and **fold novelty**, where it
**edges ESMFold2 on novel folds** (0.81 vs 0.79). This answers exp82's open
question: careful tuning moved the model from **~chance** (the quick #67 model)
to **ESMFold-class ranking AUC from sequence alone**.

**2. Top-K precision — structure methods win decisively.** At R-precision and
contacts@L, MarinFold (0.269 / 0.188 long-range) sits **well below every
structure predictor** (ESMFold2 0.769 / 0.443; Protenix-MSA 0.795 / 0.465). It
orders contacts broadly well but does not concentrate confidence on the true top
contacts. (AUC also somewhat favours a continuous ranker — MarinFold scores
every pair — over structure-derived contact sets that tie most pairs at degree
0; the top-K precision metrics are the fairer "did you find the contacts"
comparison.)

**Heatmaps (`plots/heatmap_{1QYS,7BNY,1UBQ}.png`,
[`benchmark_heatmaps.py`](benchmark_heatmaps.py)).** For the three canonical test
proteins — 1QYS (Top7), 7BNY, 1UBQ — each figure shows ground-truth pyconfind
contacts next to the model's **P(contact)** (the probability it emits each pair
as its next contact statement). The model puts **structured off-diagonal mass
that tracks the real contacts** (β-hairpin corners, long-range bands) — *not* the
diagonal-only sequence-separation gradient exp82 saw for the near-chance #67
model. Visual confirmation of finding 1.

## Ensembling over the document randomization (test-time augmentation)

contacts-v1 builds each document with two **random nuisances**: the N-terminus
**start position** (`(start+k) mod 2000`) and the **order** of the `<pX> <AA>`
statements. The model trained on these, so P(contact) should be invariant to
them — but a finite model isn't, and the single-realization eval above picks one
arbitrary draw. Resampling the sequence definition **K=10** times and averaging
the per-pair P(contact) (a Monte-Carlo marginal over the nuisance) is free —
no retraining, no ground truth.

Run on **iris** — vLLM on **6× v5p-8** (us-east5-a), generation-logprobs,
`bf16` ([`ensemble_worker_vllm_tpu.py`](ensemble_worker_vllm_tpu.py),
[`gen_ensemble_prompts.py`](gen_ensemble_prompts.py)). The bf16/TPU
single-realization matches the local bf16/transformers numbers within ≤ 0.006
(AUC-long 0.879 vs 0.881; R-long 0.263 vs 0.269), so the backend is faithful.
(Both runs are bf16 — `score_eval_set.py` uses the `Scorer` default — so this
is a backend check, not a precision check.)
**K=10 ensemble vs single, same backend, n=554:**

| long-range | single | **K=10 ensemble** | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| AUC | 0.879 | **0.899** | +0.020 |
| R-precision | 0.263 | **0.315** | **+0.051** |
| contacts@L | 0.184 | **0.209** | +0.025 |

The gain holds across all 554 proteins and is **largest on R-precision** (the
weak spot) — variance reduction sharpens the top-K ranking, as the 10-protein
probe predicted. It pushes long-range **AUC 0.88 → 0.90 (≈ ESMFold2's 0.92)**
but **does not close the top-K gap** (R-precision 0.32 vs ESMFold2's 0.77). The
local transformers path ([`score_eval_set_vllm.py`](score_eval_set_vllm.py) is
the iris/vLLM variant) gives the same definition.

## Scaling: contact accuracy vs eval loss across the #75 sweep

Scoring the sweep's other per-epoch winners (E1/E2/E4) through the same harness
(single realization, no ensembling) next to E8 shows that contact prediction
**emerges sharply, not smoothly**, with the training objective:

| ckpt | epochs | lr / wd | eval loss | AUC (long) | R-precision (all / long) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | 1 | 7e-4 / wd0.05 | 3.046 | 0.615 | 0.028 / 0.022 |
| E2 | 2 | 7e-4 / wd0.8 | 2.942 | 0.623 | 0.029 / 0.024 |
| E4 | 4 | 1e-3 / wd0.05 | 2.924 | 0.620 | 0.031 / 0.023 |
| **E8** | 8 | 1e-3 / wd0.2 | **2.757** | **0.881** | **0.339 / 0.269** |

E1–E4 sit at **near-chance** contact accuracy (R-precision ≈ 0.03, AUC ≈ 0.62)
across a 0.12-nat span of eval loss (3.05 → 2.92); then **E8, only 0.17 nats
lower (2.76), jumps ~10× on R-precision and to ESMFold-class AUC**. The last
stretch of loss reduction is where the contact signal appears. (E1 ≈ the #67
model's regime — loss 2.98, also near-chance — a cross-check.) Caveat: four
points, and the cells differ in lr/wd, so this is loss-vs-accuracy across
heterogeneous runs, not a controlled epoch sweep. Plot:
`plots/loss_vs_rprecision.png` ([`loss_vs_rprecision.py`](loss_vs_rprecision.py)).

## Conclusion

The carefully-tuned contacts-v1 1.5B (eval loss 2.7566) has a **real,
MSA-depth-robust contact signal**: from sequence alone it ranks residue–residue
contacts about as well as ESMFold by AUC (and better than single-sequence
Protenix-v2), a large jump over the near-chance #67 model that exp82 measured.
It is **not yet a high-precision contact predictor** — its top-K precision
(contacts@L, R-precision) is far below the structure-based methods, so for
"high-confidence contact" use it trails ESMFold / ESMFold2 / Protenix-MSA. Net:
tuning closed the *ranking* gap but not the *top-K precision* gap; the next
lever is sharpening the model's top predictions (or a larger / longer-trained
model), not the decoder. **Ensembling K=10 resampled sequence definitions**
(free, no retraining) is one cheap step in that direction — +0.05 R-precision
and AUC up to ≈ ESMFold2 — but it narrows rather than closes the top-K gap.

_(Suggested follow-ups, for a human to decide: (a) protenix-distogram AUC needs
the saved distograms — only its precision is included here; (b) a higher-quality
calibration / sharpening of the top predictions; (c) the vLLM/iris-TPU run as the
canonical platform reproduction.)_
