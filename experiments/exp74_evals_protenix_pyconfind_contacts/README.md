# exp: run protenix v2 and pyconfind on updated eval set (foldbench-100 + newly curated set in exp65)

**Issue:** [#74](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/issues/74) · **Kind:** `evals` · **Branch:** `exp/74-protenix-pyconfind-contacts`

## Question

How well does Protenix v2 do at **contact prediction** when contacts are
defined with [pyconfind](https://github.com/timodonnell/pyconfind), on an
updated eval set (FoldBench-100 from [#12](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/issues/12)
plus the low-MSA / structurally-novel set curated in
[#65](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/issues/65))?

## Background

We're training models that only do contact prediction now, so the eval
focus shifts from distance/structure accuracy (exp12) to **contact
accuracy**, with extra attention to **low-MSA-depth** proteins. This
experiment extends exp12 in three ways (expand the eval set; define
ground truth with pyconfind; score Protenix contact prediction in four
configs) — see the issue text reproduced under "Approach (from the
issue)" below.

This builds on:
- **exp12** — Protenix v2 on Modal (single-seq + MSA), distogram capture,
  the `best/` top-1 picker. We **reuse its harness** and its already-computed
  FoldBench-100 outputs from the HF bucket (no re-run for FoldBench).
- **exp65** — the 454-candidate low-MSA / novel-fold set (de-novo, CASP-FM,
  CAMEO-hard) with per-candidate `neff_tier` / `fold_verdict` / `seq_leakage`
  labels we stratify on.
- **contacts_v1** (`marinfold.document_structures.contacts_v1`) — the
  pyconfind side-chain-contact recipe our training documents use; the
  ground truth here is defined identically.

## Approach (from the issue)

> Extend experiment #12 in three ways: (1) add the exp65 candidates to the
> FoldBench-100 set; (2) compute ground-truth contacts with pyconfind, run
> like contacts_v1 (`native_only=True`, cd threshold 0.001) — save all
> contacts, eval only on primary separation ≥ 6; (3) score Protenix in four
> configs = {single-seq, msa} × {distogram, structure}. Distogram: rank by
> cumulative probability the representative atoms are within ~8 Å. Structure:
> run pyconfind on the predicted structure (`native_only=True`) and rank by
> contact degree. Plot contacts @ L in aggregate and split short / medium /
> long. Use Modal. Save raw results to the HF bucket; document here.

## Method (reproduction spec)

### Eval sets
- **FoldBench-100** — the 100 proteins from exp12. We reuse exp12's Protenix
  outputs (`best/{mode}/{stem}/{structure.cif,distogram.npz}`) and GT CIFs
  directly from the HF bucket `open-athena/MarinFold`
  (`data/protenix-foldbench-monomers/`); **no Protenix re-run**.
- **exp65** — all **454** unique candidates from
  [`candidate_2d_label.csv`](../exp65_evals_low_msa_depth_proteins/data/candidate_2d_label.csv)
  (396 de-novo, 32 CAMEO-hard, 26 CASP-FM; the 3 stems shared between de-novo
  and CAMEO are de-duplicated). Input sequences come from exp65's
  `candidate_sequences.csv`. Lengths 33–460 aa (median 148), so nothing is
  excluded for size.

### Protenix run (Modal)
Reuses exp12's harness ([`modal_app.py`](modal_app.py),
[`distogram_hook.py`](distogram_hook.py), [`select_best.py`](select_best.py),
[`msa_depth.py`](msa_depth.py)), pointed at the exp65 inputs
([`prepare_exp65.py`](prepare_exp65.py)). Protenix v2 on H100, **5 seeds × 8
diffusion samples**, N_cycle=10, in both `single_seq` and `msa` mode
(`--use_msa true/false`); MSAs pre-computed once via Protenix's ColabFold
backend (same pipeline as FoldBench-100). Top-1 sample per (protein, mode)
by `ranking_score`; the distogram kept is the one from that seed. The
Protenix v2 weights volume is shared with exp12.

### Ground-truth contacts (pyconfind) — [`pyconfind_contacts.py`](pyconfind_contacts.py)
Run **exactly like contacts_v1** (verified against
`contacts_v1.GenerationConfig` defaults): `native_only=True`,
`contact_distance=3.0`, `dcut=25.0`, `clash_distance=2.0`, `assembly=None`.
We **save every contact pyconfind emits** (degree > 0); a **"true" contact**
for eval is one with **degree ≥ 0.001** (`min_contact_degree`, the issue's
"cd threshold of 0.001") **and primary-sequence separation ≥ 6**
(`min_seq_separation`). The single GT chain is extracted from the
(possibly multi-chain assembly) structure before analysis.

### The four configs and the metric — [`contact_eval.py`](contact_eval.py)
Ground truth is the same for all four configs; predictors differ:
- **distogram**: per-pair score = Σ distogram mass on Protenix-v2 bins with
  center ≤ **8 Å** = P(CB-CB ≤ 8 Å) (exp12's contact probability). 8 Å is the
  default; the saved distograms make a threshold sweep cheap.
- **structure**: run pyconfind on the predicted top-1 CIF (same knobs as GT),
  score = predicted **contact degree** (0 for unpredicted pairs).

**Metric — contacts @ L**: precision among the top-L ranked pairs (L =
sequence length), also @ L/2, @ L/5, and **R-precision** (precision@R where
R = the bin's ground-truth contact count, so the ceiling is 1.0 for every
protein — the density-robust cut, equal to recall@R). Reported **in
aggregate** (sep ≥ 6) and **split** short [6,11] / medium [12,23] / long
[≥24]. The candidate-pair universe is restricted to residues **resolved in
the GT structure**, identically across all four configs, so the numbers are
comparable.

> **Note on the metric.** pyconfind contacts are sparser than the CB-CB ≤ 8 Å
> contacts of classic CASP precision@L (≈0.85/residue here — mean `n_true/L`
> over the 554 proteins; 0.90 on FoldBench-100), so precision@L is
> bounded by contact density for short proteins (a perfect predictor caps at
> `n_true/L`); L/2, L/5, and especially **R-precision** (ceiling 1.0 for every
> protein) sidestep this. Also, the **distogram** configs
> rank by a CB-CB-distance notion against a side-chain-contact ground truth,
> so they carry an inherent representation gap vs the **structure** configs —
> this is the eval the issue asked for, and the structure configs are the
> apples-to-apples ones.

### Index alignment
pyconfind numbers contacts over a structure's *resolved* residues; the
distogram / predicted structure are indexed by the input sequence. We align
the two by difflib (decoupled from residue numbering) and remap every contact
to input-sequence coordinates, so GT, distogram, and predicted-structure
contacts share one `[0, L)` space. A per-protein **alignment identity** is
recorded; FoldBench-100 validation showed 1.000 across the board.

## Success criteria

A single tidy `contact_precision.csv` covering FoldBench-100 + all 454 exp65
candidates, with contacts @ L / L2 / L5 for all four configs, aggregate and
by range; plots of the above (incl. stratified by MSA-depth tier and fold
novelty); raw pyconfind contacts + Protenix outputs on the HF bucket. We
expect MSA ≫ single-seq and the structure predictor ≥ distogram predictor
(confirmed on the FoldBench-100 validation subset).

## Results

Scored **554 proteins** — FoldBench-100 + all 454 exp65 candidates (396
de-novo, 32 CAMEO-hard, 26 CASP-FM) — in all four configs. pyconfind
ground-truth alignment identity was **≥ 0.95 for every structure** (mean
0.999), so the resolved-residue → input-sequence mapping is sound across
the heterogeneous set (RCSB assemblies, CASP domain clips, designed
monomers). All numbers are mean contact precision; source data is
[`data/contact_precision_all.csv`](data/contact_precision_all.csv) (tidy,
one row per stem × mode × predictor × range × k).

**Contacts @ L (k=1), by config:**

| set | predictor | MSA agg | MSA long | SS agg | SS long |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FoldBench-100 | structure | **0.77** | 0.55 | 0.25 | 0.16 |
| FoldBench-100 | distogram | 0.45 | 0.39 | 0.21 | 0.15 |
| exp65 (454) | structure | **0.70** | 0.45 | **0.58** | 0.36 |
| exp65 (454) | distogram | 0.44 | 0.36 | 0.39 | 0.31 |

(FoldBench-100 structure·MSA contacts @ L/5 = 0.91 agg / 0.90 long.)

Two robust patterns:
1. **The structure predictor beats the distogram predictor** in every
   setting — expected, since it shares pyconfind's side-chain-contact
   notion while the distogram ranks by a CB-CB ≤ 8 Å distance proxy.
2. **MSA ≫ single-seq on FoldBench-100, but the gap collapses on exp65**
   (structure agg: 0.77→0.25 vs 0.70→0.58). exp65 is exactly the
   low-MSA / novel regime where MSA mode has little coevolution signal to
   exploit.

**The MSA advantage scales with MSA depth** — exp65 long-range structure
contacts @ L by Neff tier ([`plots/contacts_at_L_by_neff_tier.png`](plots/contacts_at_L_by_neff_tier.png)):

| neff_tier | n | MSA | single-seq | MSA−SS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| orphan (Neff≈1) | 106 | 0.414 | 0.419 | **−0.005** |
| low (1–10) | 115 | 0.452 | 0.434 | +0.018 |
| marginal (10–30) | 15 | 0.503 | 0.383 | +0.119 |
| deep (≥30) | 218 | 0.453 | 0.296 | +0.157 |

For orphan / low-Neff proteins, **single-sequence Protenix is on par with
MSA mode**; the MSA benefit only materializes once the MSA is deep.

**By fold novelty** (exp65 long-range structure contacts @ L;
[`plots/contacts_at_L_by_fold_verdict.png`](plots/contacts_at_L_by_fold_verdict.png)):
novel_fold 0.39 / 0.28 (MSA/SS), same_fold 0.44 / 0.39, redundant 0.46 /
0.35 — novel folds are hardest, as expected.

**R-precision** (precision@R, R = the bin's true-contact count; ceiling 1.0,
so ranges are directly comparable) shows the model ranks contacts **equally
well at every separation** — the low short-range precision@L above is purely
the density cap, not a model weakness:

| set | predictor·mode | short | medium | long | agg |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FoldBench-100 | structure·MSA | 0.84 | 0.85 | 0.83 | 0.85 |
| exp65 | structure·MSA | 0.81 | 0.82 | 0.79 | 0.80 |
| exp65 | structure·SS | — | — | 0.64 | 0.67 |

(FoldBench structure·MSA R-precision ≈ 0.84 flat across short/medium/long,
vs 0.12 / 0.16 / 0.55 at precision@L.) The MSA-depth story is even cleaner in
R-precision — exp65 long-range structure R-precision, MSA−SS gap by tier:
orphan **−0.01**, low +0.04, marginal +0.20, deep +0.27
([`plots/contacts_at_R_by_neff_tier.png`](plots/contacts_at_R_by_neff_tier.png)).

Plots in [`plots/`](plots/): contacts @ L / L2 / L5 / **R-precision** by
config and range; the neff_tier and fold_verdict stratifications (at both L
and R); R-precision vs Neff; and FoldBench-vs-exp65. Raw Protenix outputs +
the full pyconfind contact tables (every degree>0 contact, GT + predicted;
696k rows) are on the HF bucket under `data/protenix-contacts-eval-exp74/`.

## Conclusion

Protenix v2 predicts pyconfind-defined contacts well in MSA mode on
natural proteins (FoldBench-100 structure-config contacts @ L = 0.77, @
L/5 = 0.91). The headline finding for our purposes: **on low-MSA-depth
proteins the single-sequence and MSA modes converge** — for orphan/low-Neff
candidates single-sequence is as accurate as MSA mode, and the MSA
advantage grows monotonically with MSA depth (R-precision long-range
MSA−SS gap −0.01 → +0.27 from orphan to deep). That's encouraging for a
single-sequence contact-prediction model: in the regime where MSAs are
shallow — the regime that matters for us — there is little left on the
table by not using an MSA. The **structure** configs (pyconfind on the
predicted structure) are the apples-to-apples comparison to our
pyconfind ground truth; the **distogram** configs sit lower because of
the CB-CB-distance vs side-chain-contact representation gap, not
necessarily worse prediction.

Caveats: precision @ L is bounded by pyconfind's contact density
(≈0.85 contacts/residue), so it understates short-range performance —
**R-precision** is the cleaner read (the model is flat at ~0.84 across
short/medium/long for FoldBench structure·MSA, vs 0.12/0.16/0.55 at
precision@L). The 8 Å distogram threshold is a default and can be swept
cheaply against the saved distograms.
